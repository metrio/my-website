            <p>I'm a former Pastry Chef who reignited their passion for Software Engineering. 
               I have experience developing websites, online applications, creating databases, mentoring, and animations.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not coding you can find me biking around the city, volunteering to help communities, and cooking in my kitchen. 
                I also love playing video and board games, listening to music, and hiking.
